Overview
This project is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework, and it has been initiated using create-next-app. The setup is designed to offer developers a quick start with Next.js including its optimal configurations.

Quick Start Guide
Running the Development Server

To get the development environment running, you will need to execute one of the following commands based on your package manager preference. This will start a local development server and will allow you to view the application in your web browser.
npm run dev
# or use Yarn
yarn dev
# or use pnpm
pnpm dev
# or use Bun
bun dev

After running the command, open your web browser and enter http://localhost:3000 to see your application in action. This development server provides hot reloading which means any changes you make to app/page.js will immediately reflect in the browser without needing a manual refresh.

Font Optimization

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize the loading of fonts, specifically the Google Font "Inter". This feature ensures that the font loads quickly and efficiently, providing a smooth experience for users.
